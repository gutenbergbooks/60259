<h1>Reminiscences of Colored People
of Princeton, N. J.</h1>

<p class="center smaller">Copyrighted 1913 by Anna Bustill-Smith.</p>

<p>There are so few histories of colored
people, so few records of their brave
and honorable deeds in history, that I
feel constrained to record a few facts
relative to these people. It is only a
cursory glance I can give—I could easily
enlarge the sketch to twice this size.</p>

<p>We are proud when we read in Nell’s
“Colored Patriots of the Revolution”
that <i>Oliver Cromwell</i> enlisted in a company
commanded by Capt. Lowrey, attached
to the Second New Jersey Regiment,
under command of Col. Israel
Shreve. He was at the Battles of Trenton,
<i>Princeton</i>, Brandywine, Monmouth
and Yorktown. He was with
the army at the retreat of the Delaware
on the memorable crossing of December,
1776, and relates the story of
the battles of the succeeding days with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
enthusiasm. He gives the details of
the march from Trenton to <i>Princeton</i>,
and told with much humor “that they
knocked the British about lively at
<i>Princeton</i>.” His discharge (says Dr.
McCune Smith) at the end of the war,
was in <i>Washington’s own handwriting</i>.
He was very proud of it and often
spoke of it. He received an annual pension
of $96 until his death, January
24th, 1853, aged 100 years. Had he
been white, every newspaper in the
land would have been eloquent in his
praise.</p>

<p>Henry Hill was also in the battle of
<i>Princeton</i>. He was buried with the
honors of war in 1833.</p>

<p><i>Caesar Trent</i> was well known here
in 1804. <i>Peter Polite</i>, as <i>Mr. Peter
Scudder</i> was called, accumulated some
property and owned and conducted a
confectionery on Nassau street, says
Hageman. He died in 1848.</p>

<p><i>Anthony Simmons</i> was highly esteemed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
He was the leading caterer
and his place of business was next to
Princeton Bank. His will disposed of
half a dozen properties and devised to
the Witherspoon Presbyterian Church
all the property at the corner of Green
and Witherspoon streets, worth now
about $7000, and gave a legacy of
$500 to Princeton University.</p>

<p><i>Joseph Ten Eyck</i>, a Princetonian,
was a celebrated caterer in New York
city. He had a summer home at 256
Nassau street. He died about 15 years
ago, leaving an estate of $100,000. The
largest legacy to Tuskegee Institute,
from a colored person, was $38,000,
from Mrs. Mary Hood Shaw, his adopted
daughter. Virtually his money.</p>

<p><i>Gilbert Scudder, Sr.</i>, operated a barber
shop on Nassau street, and rated
professors among his patrons.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Catharine Scudder</i>, his widow,
is still an active, energetic woman,
owning several properties. She is full<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
of happy reminiscences, and is one of
the oldest members of the Presbyterian
Church. She brought with her, when
a bride, the first piano owned by a colored
family in Princeton. Her daughter
is a musician and elocutionist. Her
sons are well-settled in business. Eugene
conducts a second-hand clothing
house on Baker street. Walter is a
practicing physician in Philadelphia.</p>

<p><i>Elias Hart</i> owned and conducted a
restaurant on Witherspoon street. His
widow still owns and occupies the property.</p>

<p><i>Samuel Onque</i> and his brother owned
a farm opposite.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Hoagland</i> purchased a lot from
it on which he built his home. His
widow was a great worker in the Presbyterian
Church.</p>

<p><i>Mr. John Voorhees</i> was an elder in
the Presbyterian Church. He and his
wife, Amanda, owned a comfortable
home, 23 Quarry street. He left his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
estate in the hands of Mr. Joseph
Bruere. After the death of Mr. Voorhees
the church received $400 from the
estate.</p>

<p><i>Elias Conover</i> was for twenty-five
years in the Seminary. <i>Robert Hendrickson</i>
and <i>Charles Whychoff</i> have
followed him.</p>

<p><i>Philip Scudder</i> was for many years
sexton at Cemetery.</p>

<p><i>Isaac Stockton</i> conducted a grocery
store corner Green and Witherspoon
streets. He was a shrewd and successful
business man.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Margaret Stockton</i> was quite as
well known as <i>Mrs. Craig</i>. She and
Mrs. Catharine Scudder are about the
last of Princeton’s colored aristocracy.
Her daughter, <i>Miss Martie Craig</i>, was
an accomplished belle in her day. She
was a great helper in the Presbyterian
Church.</p>

<p><i>Charles Craig</i> was the pioneer hackman,
and his wife a famous cook. Their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
son, <i>Prof. Walter Craig</i>, was New
York’s most famous colored violinist,
and their daughter, <i>Jestina</i>, was school
teacher and skilled pianist.</p>

<p>The <i>Gordons</i> were a large and influential
family, like the <i>Simpsons</i>. <i>Mr.
Simpson</i> was the pioneer second-hand
clothes dealer.</p>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. Jesse Williams were
the pioneer club-house keepers. Their
numerous family still survive and reside
in the homestead on Harrison
street.</p>

<p>Mr. Thomas James was a familiar
figure for some years. He was related
to one of the oldest and most aristocratic
families in Philadelphia. In his
early life in Princeton he was thrifty
and prosperous. His children buried
him quite recently.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Elon Berry</i> is our “shut-in,”
but sends out sunshine.</p>

<p>“Some are and must be greater than
the rest.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<p>As early as 1816 a Mr. Boardman, a
colored student, was here. Many have
since graduated from the Seminary.
Revs. L. Z. Johnson and G. S. Stark
received the degree of A. B. on examination.</p>

<p><i>Betsey Stockton</i> was one of the first
members of the Presbyterian Church.
Hageman tells us “she was a woman
of sterling qualities and an excellent
teacher.” She was the first colored missionary
to the Hawaiian Islands and,
on her return, taught school. One of
her pupils, <i>Mr. Thomas Schenck</i>,
attended Lincoln University, graduating
in 1869. A bronze tablet to her
memory was recently unveiled in the
Presbyterian Church by Mr. Weber, a
former pupil, Gen. A. A. Woodhull
making the address. A stained glass
memorial window, the gift of her pupils,
adorns the church and attests to
her ability and their love.</p>

<p><i>Rev. Chas. W. Gardiner</i> was pastor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
of the First African Presbyterian
Church of Philadelphia for 12 years,
and an early record says “he was no
mean expounder of the Word of God.”
He was a man of high mental attainments.
His preaching was eloquent,
impressive and effective. He was ever
regarded as a profound thinker and
leading ecclesiastical. In 1857 he was
invited by my father, Joseph C. Bustill
(then teaching there), to help form the
First Colored Presbyterian Church of
Harrisburg, Pa. He was pastor there
several years. A fine portrait of him
still hangs in the lecture room, evidencing
their veneration for him. He
spent the remaining years of his life at
his home, corner Green and Witherspoon
streets. Dr. Ashbel Green was
always interested in him and remembered
him in his will. His grandchildren,
<i>Mrs. Till</i> and <i>Mrs. Boyer</i> are still
among us.</p>

<p><i>Rev. Mahlon Van Horn</i> was graduated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
from Lincoln University and, for
twenty-five years, was pastor of a congregational
church at Newport, R. I.
He was appointed U. S. Consul at St.
Thomas Island, and filled his position
with honor to himself and with satisfaction
to the Government. He died in
office.</p>

<p>Who could write of Princeton colored
people and omit <i>Uncle Jimmy Johnson</i>?
“He was at one time the oldest
person connected with the university,
because he had known Dr. Duffield
s-s-since he was in kn-kn-knickerbockers.”
He came here a fugitive slave, was
recognized by a student and soon was
fleeing from the dreaded slave catcher.
Mrs. Provost paid the $1000 demanded
and the students paid the cost of the
sensational trial. Mr. Johnson often
showed with justifiable pride his account
of the <i>repayment of every cent</i>.
He lived long to enjoy his freedom and
was ever affectionately regarded by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
students. A granite stone “erected by
graduates of Princeton University”
marks his grave. His widow was a
woman of fine presence, cultured and
refined. She died less than a year ago.</p>

<p><i>James Titus, Sr.</i>, who owned his
home on Green street, was for many
years the trusted messenger of the university.
His son, <i>James, Jr.</i>, was twenty-eight
years gold melter and refiner
for M. F. Cronin, Seventh and Sansom
streets, Philadelphia. His son, <i>James,
III</i>, owns several properties and resides
in our town. His son, <i>George P. Titus</i>,
was associated with his father till his
death, when he succeeded him. He is
now practical and consulting metalurgist
for the Deuber Watchcase Manufacturing
Co., Canton, O. His son,
James, IV, graduated from the high
school and business college of Canton,
and is his father’s assistant. A son of
James, III, holds a position in the same
company.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Rev. William D. Robeson</i> was, for
nearly twenty-five years, pastor of the
Presbyterian Church. He was a graduate
of Lincoln University and Seminary.
His many superior qualities of
mind and heart won for him many
friends and kept his work pre-eminent.
He gave to Princeton the best years of
his life, made many improvements in
the church methods and church property.
He is ever the defender of justice—standing
firmly for the rights of
our race. He is a Christian gentleman.
Two churches he has pastored since are
gratified to have him help them so much—financially
as well as spiritually.
He is particularly successful in collecting
funds. He has built one church and
liquidated a large indebtedness on the
other. He and his wife M. Louisa
Bustill (a Philadelphia school teacher),
are of blessed memory to those who
knew them. Their son, <i>William D., Jr.</i>,
is the only colored Princeton graduate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
of the Trenton High School. A graduate
of Lincoln University, studied
medicine at University of Pennsylvania.
<i>Reeve</i> is doing well in Detroit.
<i>Bennie</i> graduated from Biddle University
and is now in the seminary. <i>Marion</i>
graduated from Scotia and <i>Paul
Bustill</i> is a member of the baseball,
football and basketball teams and the
Glee Club of Somerville High School.</p>

<p>“<i>Mom Stewart</i>” is a class by herself.
Always jolly, sensible and persevering.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Sarah Dillon</i> is one of the oldest
members of the Methodist Church. She
has taught in the Presbyterian Sunday-school
more than 50 years.</p>

<p>Her neighbor, <i>Miss Mary Chew</i>,
owns several Lytle street properties.</p>

<p>Of our young people, <i>Mrs. Annie
Vanzant Moore</i> and <i>Mrs. Lillian Scudder
Proctor</i>, have taught in the public
school. <i>Miss Eva Royster</i> is our only
graduate from the Trenton Art School.
<i>Leah Lake</i>, <i>Bertha Hall</i>, <i>Virginia<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
Smith Rhetta</i>, and <i>Ethel Vanzant</i> had
partial courses in Trenton High
School. <i>John Richmond</i>, <i>Bessie Moore</i>,
<i>Marie French</i>, <i>Jenetta Watkins</i> and
<i>Laura Garner</i> are the first colored
pupils to enter Princeton High School.
Several boys and girls are pursuing
educational courses or following professions
away from Princeton. <i>Dr. J.
E. Proctor</i> is our only colored physician.
<i>F. Louis Sperling</i> our only lawyer
and Justice of the Peace.</p>

<p>The church music is of excellent character,
being in such skillful hands as
<i>Mrs. Blackwell</i>, <i>Mrs. Lambert</i> and <i>Mrs.
Robinson</i>.</p>

<p>The Hoaglands, Sortors, Millers,
Vanzants, Schencks, Lakes, Skillmans,
Scudders, Roysters, Hagamans, Conovers,
Van Horns, Eustices, Tituses,
and many others were large and highly-respected
families still represented.</p>

<p>The Witherspoon Presbyterian
Church is the most flourishing. It has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
a large auditorium and parish house
and several properties, all in good condition.
They are valued at $37,000.
Rev. G. S. Stark is pastor.</p>

<p>Mt. Pisgah A. M. E. Church maintains
its usual high standard. It was
recently enlarged and remodeled. It
is valued at $15,000—Rev. Sturgis,
pastor. The late Addison Gordon was
a class leader and gave it a legacy
from his $30,000 estate.</p>

<p>The late Henry Shaw, Robert Hall,
Mrs. Dowers, Mrs. Oakham and many
more are its helpers. Mrs. Letitia
Blackwell was the oldest member.</p>

<p>Bright Hope Baptist Church has a
commodious building, with lecture room
in basement—$12,000; Rev. Jones is
pastor. All three churches have their
own parsonages, electric light and
steam heat.</p>

<p>The Odd Fellows, Knights of Pythias,
Elks, Mooses and Good Samaritans are
trustworthy beneficial Orders. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
Odd Fellows own their own hall. A
company of colored men own and rent
Douglass Hall.</p>

<p>A Young Men’s Christian Association
has been fitted up in a very spacious
and comfortable building. Meetings,
books, entertainment, etc., appeal
to the men. Joseph W. Rhetta is secretary.
The Women’s Club is successfully
teaching several branches of industry
and furnishes entertainment for
the women.</p>

<p>Our business men are William
Moore, John Williams, George Mention,
William Higgins, Theodore Williams,
James Dickerson, Peter Brownley,
William Green, Andrew Melchoir, Robert
Braxton, John Coy, I. R. Farrier
and Mr. Sheldon. Mrs. Shaw and Mrs.
Burrill are our business women.</p>

<p>Much I intended for this brief sketch
is, of necessity, omitted, but I hope
another may write more fully of the
colored people of <i>Princeton</i>.</p>
